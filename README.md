## 1. Introduction
The Secure Shell protocol, commonly called SSH, is a secure communication protocol used to access and execute commands on remote computer systems.

SSH offers a number of features : encryption of exchanged data, authenticated access, tunneling, port forwarding and secure file transfer.

SSH replaces less secure protocols such as Telnet.

## 2. Operations on Linux distributions
Before you start, you must have **root mode access** to a remote computer system, such as a physical server or a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

**Root** refers to the primary or superuser account which has complete administrative privileges, allowing it to perform any operation on the system.

### Create a personal user account
Open a Terminal - also known as Shell or Command Line Interface - on your local Operating System.

Then, type in the command prompt :
```
ssh root@ip_address
```
Press ENTER after each command line.
